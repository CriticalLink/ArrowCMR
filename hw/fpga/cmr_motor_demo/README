This project is the base for generating the different MitySOM-5CSx Dev Kit
variants. The Makefile automatically compiles the project and will create a
directory, 'stamps', for it's own use. Deleting the 'stamps' directory will
cause the Makefile to loose track of what has and has not been built and
everything will be rebuilt.


To generate a project variant:

Change the value of the Make variable 'SOM_MODEL' in the Makefile to a valid
model number, and run 'make generate_from_tcl'. The other Make targets can now
be run.


After a project has been generated:

Run 'make all' to compile the project.
